# Alfred Framework

A framework for building self-improving AI executive assistants with Claude Code.

## What This Is

Alfred Framework is a structured methodology for turning Claude Code into an executive assistant that manages your pipeline, enforces accountability, detects your avoidance patterns, and improves itself over time. It's not a library — it's a set of behavioral rules, reusable skills, auto-activating agents, and self-optimization systems that make Claude Code operate as a strategic partner rather than a chatbot.

This framework was extracted from a production system that manages a freelance consulting business: daily briefings, pipeline tracking, outreach drafting, proposal generation, meeting prep, and weekly reviews — all with dual logging to both CRM and local files.

## Key Concepts

### Rules (the brain)
Three files define how your assistant thinks:
- **`behavior.md`** — 21 behavioral rules covering priority enforcement, brutal honesty, pattern recognition, decision forcing, avoidance detection, session management, and context capture
- **`voice.md`** — Communication style: brevity over completeness, specifics over generalities, deadlines over intentions
- **`self-optimization.md`** — 10 systems for continuous improvement: component creation (3-time rule), template evolution, relationship decay detection, time allocation analysis, stale data detection, and context window management

### Skills (user-invoked workflows)
Multi-step procedures triggered by `/skill-name`. Each skill is a self-contained markdown file with numbered steps. 35 skills included — from daily briefings to adversarial decision debates.

### Agents (auto-activating experts)
Domain specialists that activate when context matches — no explicit trigger needed. 8 agents included — from Astro site building to Korean business etiquette.

### Templates (structured output)
Markdown templates for recurring outputs (briefings, proposals, reviews). The assistant fills the template — the user reviews and acts.

### Self-Optimization
The system improves itself:
- **3-Time Rule** — after doing the same task 3 times manually, propose creating a skill/agent
- **Template Evolution** — rotating weekly feedback questions → template updates after 4 data points
- **Outreach Intelligence** — after 15+ entries, recommend angles, channels, and timing
- **Time Allocation Analysis** — track category drift, escalate when priorities are misaligned
- **Relationship Decay** — compute reactivation scores, surface overdue contacts
- **Stale Data Detection** — flag tracking files past freshness thresholds

## Quick Start

1. Copy `framework/` into your project's `.claude/` directory:
```bash
cp -r framework/rules/ .claude/rules/
cp -r framework/conventions/ .claude/conventions/
cp -r framework/templates/ templates/
```

2. Copy skills and agents you want:
```bash
# Copy all skills
cp -r skills/ .claude/skills/

# Copy all agents
cp -r agents/ .claude/agents/

# Or pick individually
cp -r skills/briefing/ .claude/skills/briefing/
cp -r agents/deal-closing-expert/ .claude/agents/deal-closing-expert/
```

3. Create your `CLAUDE.md` using `examples/freelance-consultant/CLAUDE.md` as a starting point. Customize:
   - Your context (who you are, what matters)
   - Your top priority
   - Your trigger table (what commands you want)
   - Your decision framework

4. Replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` in copied skills with your actual values:
   - `[YOUR_RATE]` → your daily rate
   - `[YOUR_CITY]` → your location
   - `[YOUR_TIMEZONE]` → your timezone (e.g., "America/New_York")
   - `[YOUR_ROLE]` → your professional role
   - `[YOUR_MARKET]` → your target market
   - `[BURN_RATE]` → your monthly expenses
   - `[HEALTH_TRACKER]` → your wearable (Oura, Whoop, etc.)
   - `[STUDY_APP]` → your learning app

5. Start a Claude Code session. The assistant will read your rules and operate accordingly.

## Philosophy

**Rules over prompts.** A well-defined behavioral rule ("If the user asks to work on something that's not their top priority, checkpoint them") produces better results than a vague instruction ("be helpful and keep the user focused"). Rules are testable, debuggable, and composable.

**Skills over memory.** Instead of hoping the AI remembers your preferred workflow, encode it as a numbered procedure. Skills are deterministic — they run the same way every time, across sessions.

**Self-optimization over manual tuning.** The system proposes its own improvements. After 3 repeated tasks → suggests a new skill. After 15 outreach entries → recommends the best-performing angle. After 2 weeks of priority drift → escalates. You approve or reject — the system doesn't change itself without permission.

**Load on demand.** Not every file needs to be in context every session. Define a trigger-to-file mapping in CLAUDE.md so the assistant loads what it needs, when it needs it. This is how you scale to 30+ reference files without blowing the context window.

**Track everything, archive aggressively.** Dual-log to both structured systems (CRM) and local markdown. Archive processed entries monthly. Never archive wins.
